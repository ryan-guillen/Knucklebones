# Knucklebones

A simple recreation of the mini-game "Knucklebones" from the game Cult of the Lamb.  
Front end made with React and tailwind.  
Back end made with Node.js and Express.  
Front end connects to my back-end server with socket.io.

## Demo

Both the front end and back end use HTTPS. If you want to run this, you will either
need to have your own cert and key, or use HTTP.
